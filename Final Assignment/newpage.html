                 Being the largest lake in the state, Lake Shasta, located along Interstate 5 in Northern California, can supply water up to 500 miles south to farms in the central valley. Millions of residents across the state rely on water from this lake. The lake also serves as a tourism destination, with hundreds of boats in the water at any given time.</p> 

                <p>Now during the drive up I-5 over Lake Shasta, travelers will see more brown than they will blue. The tree line on the lake is over 100 feet above the water level. </p>

            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm" style="font-family: battambang;">
                <p> In the past, the lake level would reach all the way up to the tree line. But now, the ever-growing gap between the water level and the tree line makes the lake look less recognizable every year. </p>

                <p> Lake Shasta is one example of a dangerous state-wide trend. The majority of reservoirs across California have the same distinctive dry gap between the water and the plants. The drought that has been plaguing the state for decades never seems to rebound enough to get the lakes back to the desired level.

                 Lake Shasta for example, has been on a downward trend over the last decade. As of December 14th, Lake Shasta is 146 feet below its full surface level. The lake is also only 30% full. The patterns of this lake have been up and down but these numbers come from after two weeks of rain in the area. The state isn't expected to get rain for a long time, further endangering the lake and those who use it.
            </p>

              <p>A decade ago, the lake was in a similar position in terms of its elevation below full. The lake experiences lots of rain over the winter and spring months before receiving next to nothing over the summer. This is a normal phenomenon that happens in California. But the amount of rain in April has been getting lower and lower. This can be blamed on less than normal rainfall in winter.

      <p>The water levels are up from last year. However, this is not because of all the rain. The state announced last year that they were not going to let as much water go through the damns. While it’s great for those with boats on the lake. Everyone else is forced to adapt. “We don’t really use our sprinklers anymore. Nobody does,” said Alessio Colli, a college student who spends his summers in San Francisco. 
</p>
  <p>Many houses in the area have even begun to switch from grass to turf in reaction to the expenses of sprinklers.
</p>
<p>Within the last couple of weeks, the entire state of California has been engulfed by an atmospheric river. Unfortunately, those storms only rose water levels in reservoirs by a couple of percentage points.</p>

<p>“A few rainstorms aren’t going to take the state out of a drought,” said David Rizzardo, Supervising Engineer at the California Department of Water Resources. He said that the state had no choice but to slow out the output of water from lake Shasta because the levels of the lake were so low. There would need to be a few consistent years of rain for the state to make a comeback.

              <div class="col-md-4 col-sm">
                <p>Over the years, the drought has gone up and down, in part thanks to el Nino and la Nina bringing either dry years, in the case of la Nina, or wet years, in the case of el Nino. The state has had years where it appears as though the drought could be over for good before subsequent dry years pulled the stare back into the never-ending loop.</p>
                <p>As of today, more than 99% of the state is in some stage of drought, with 31% in either extreme or exceptional. This 31% is largely based in central California where the majority of the farms of the state are. Aquifers in the area have been drying up for decades and take much longer to recover than reservoirs. Farmers working near the dried-up aquifers are forced to turn to reservoirs like Lake Shasta.</p>

          <p>“The aquifers in the central valley need to be left alone for years in order to make a comeback,” Rizzardo said. “They cannot keep up with the amount of water being taken from them.”</p>
          <p>The rains of the past month have given California a much-needed surge to keep the state from going into a panic. Since September 25% percent of the state experienced a drop in drought level from severe to moderate, and snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is above average for this time of year, but many of the state's reservoirs still fall short of desired levels going into what is supposed to be a dry future for the state.</p>
